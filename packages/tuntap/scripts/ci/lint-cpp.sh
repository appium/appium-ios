# glob would also sweep in other platforms' sources (e.g. wintun_loader.cc on
# non-Windows), which have no compile command and fail on missing headers.
# The node_modules filter (node-addon-api's nothing.c, node-gyp's
# win_delay_load_hook.cc) is a bare substring on purpose: Windows entries use
# backslash separators, and Git Bash halves doubled backslashes in arguments
# to native executables like jq.exe, so the filter must stay backslash-free.
# jq 1.7 on Windows emits CRLF line endings; strip the \r or every filename
# handed to clang-tidy ends in a carriage return ("no such file or directory").
