/**
 * AAC-ELD constants for the DisplayService system-audio stream.
 *
 * The device streams Enhanced Low Delay AAC — not plain AAC-LC — and that
 * distinction matters for anything downstream:
 *
 * - ELD uses **480-sample** frames, where AAC-LC uses 1024. Decoders that
 *   assume the default frame size interpret each access unit as a longer block
 *   and emit clipped noise, which is why the access units must be carried in a
 *   container that states the format rather than handed over raw.
 * - ELD cannot be expressed in ADTS: the ADTS header's 2-bit profile field only
 *   covers Main/LC/SSR/LTP, so there is no valid raw framing for it. An MP4
 *   `esds` carrying the AudioSpecificConfig is the portable option — see
 *   {@link buildM4a}.

/**
 * The `AudioSpecificConfig` the device advertises during the Mirror handshake.

 * (48 kHz), channelConfiguration 2 (stereo) — **and `frameLengthFlag = 0`,
 * which claims 512-sample frames.**
 *
 * That claim is wrong. The stream really carries 480-sample frames, which is
 * provable from the data: a 20.00 s capture yielded 1996 access units, and
 * 1996 × 512 / 48000 = 21.29 s of audio, more than the window it arrived in,
 * whereas 480 gives exactly 19.96 s.
 *
 * A decoder that believes this cookie mis-slices every access unit — ffmpeg
 * reports "Number of bands (36) exceeds limit (34)" and AudioToolbox refuses
 * the stream outright. Kept only for reference and for callers reproducing the
 * device's exact handshake bytes; use {@link AAC_ELD_ASC_48K_STEREO_480} to
 * describe the stream truthfully.
