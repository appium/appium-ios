 * Receives the device's system-audio stream.
 *
 * The audio path is much simpler than video: **one RTP payload carries exactly
 * one AAC-ELD access unit** — no aggregation, no fragmentation — so this just
 * unwraps RTP and hands the encoded units over.
 *
 * Nothing here decodes the audio. Decoding AAC-ELD needs a decoder told about
 * its 480-sample frames (see `aac-eld.ts`), so this exposes the encoded units
 * plus {@link format} — including the `AudioSpecificConfig` a decoder needs —
 * and {@link recordAudioToFile} wraps them in an `.m4a` that other tools can
 * read directly.
 *
 * A lost packet drops one 10 ms unit; unlike video there is no reference chain,
 * so the stream recovers on the next packet and nothing further is discarded.
 *
 * Requires iOS 27.0+ — see {@link DisplayService} for the version gate.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const capture = await AudioStreamCapture.start(display);
 * try {
 *   for await (const au of capture.accessUnits()) {
 *     // au.data is one AAC-ELD access unit
 *   }
 * } finally {
 *   await capture.stop();
 * }
 * ```
