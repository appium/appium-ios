/**
 * Records the device's screen and system audio together, writing **two separate

 *
 * They are kept separate on purpose: combining them is a pure post-processing
 * step needing no device access, so it belongs outside this library.
 * {@link RecordScreenAndAudioResult.muxCommand} gives the exact command to run,
 * since it depends on the measured frame rate this function returns.
 *
 * Both tracks are streamed to disk as they arrive, so memory does not grow with
 * the recording's length.
 *
 * Both streams are negotiated under one shared session id, the way Xcode's
 * mirror pairs them, and are torn down in a single stop — the device has no
 * per-stream stop (see {@link DisplayService.stopAllMediaStreams}).
 *
 * Recording starts at the first video keyframe, since a decoder cannot begin on
 * a delta frame; a little audio may therefore precede the first frame.
 *
 * Both captures send periodic RTCP receiver reports, so recordings are not
 * bounded by the device's 20 s `RTCPTimeoutInterval`. Verified on iOS 27.0: a
 * 60 s recording captured 2827 video frames and 59.97 s of audio with no loss.
 * A warning is still logged if the two durations diverge, which would mean the
 * device dropped a session for some other reason.
 *
 * Requires iOS 27.0+.
 *
 * @param service A connected {@link DisplayService} for the target device.
 * @param options Output paths, duration, and video stream options.
